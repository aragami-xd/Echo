Welcome to the osu!traier game. this game will be a mouse aim training game for the popular "musical" rhythm game "osu!"

The game will feature circles to be clicked based on the beats of the song like osu!. But unlike the real game, the circle will be completely random, so there is no need for dedicated mapping. Sliders and spinners might available in the future
