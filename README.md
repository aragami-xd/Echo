Welcome to the osu!traier game. this game will be a mouse aim training game for the popular "musical" rhythm game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)

Osu! (specifically osu!standard) is a rhythm game where the player will tap an object, whether a circle or a sldier, at a certain beat of the song

The original game features the objects laid out in a specific manner by players in the community (known as "beatmapping"). However, unlike the original game, osu!trainer will generate the objects in a pseudorandom order based on the tempo of the song, giving the game a totally new and exicting play style, a combination of consistency and sharp mouse aiming reaction
