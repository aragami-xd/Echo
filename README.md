**QUICK UPDATE:** This engine is my take at some basic OpenGL and some game engine design, so it comes with many flaws or lacks features to allow me to be creative with the games built on it. Therefore I'll stop working on this project and moving onto the next version of the engine, which is now in c# .net instead of basic c++. Overall, still a successful project, and I have learnt a lot\

Welcome to the osu!trainer game (and the Echo engine). This is a mouse aim training game for the popular "musical" rhythm game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh), built on my custom-made Echo engine

Osu! (specifically osu!standard) is a rhythm game where the player will tap pre-arranged objects at a certain beat of the song to complete the level. Unlike the original game, osu!trainer features pseudo-randomized object arragements to test the player's reflection and consistency. Pretty self-explanatory, for those who have played the game before

The game will be built on my own rhythm game engine, Echo. The engine provides a pseudo-random beatmap generation tool and object templates, allows for easy expansion for any rhythm games built on it. More features are coming soon in the future, so stay tuned

- Current milestone: The first step of the engine and the game is done. The engine now renders and allows the player to tap the circle on the screen. MapGen program is not included so there will only be 1 map. Keymapping inside Settings.json (under "keymapping" variable)
