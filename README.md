Welcome to the osu!trainer game (and the ECHO engine). This is a mouse aim training game for the popular "musical" rhythm game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh), built on my custom-made ECHO engine

Osu! (specifically osu!standard) is a rhythm game where the player will tap pre-arranged objects at a certain beat of the song to complete the level. Unlike the original game, osu!trainer features pseudo-randomized object arragements to test the player's reflection and consistency. Pretty self-explanatory, for those who have played the game before

The game will be built on my own rhythm game engine, ECHO. The engine provides a pseudo-random beatmap generation tool and an object template, allows for easy expansion for any games built on it. More features are coming soon in the future, so stay tuned
